The design started from code, however, a Figma file was created to visualize design tokens for both the NYC Opportunity and Workforce Development teams. The Figma file is a companion to the [UI Patterns source code](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/working-nyc-patterns). Contents of the Figma file include:

* [Colors](https://www.figma.com/file/CH7ZOCW55SgsDnsTj3UrTi/?node-id=1%3A292) – The color scales and how they are applied to the interface as well as alternate color pallets for the interface.

* [Typography](https://www.figma.com/file/CH7ZOCW55SgsDnsTj3UrTi/?node-id=0%3A1) – The primary and secondary type designation (Montserrat and Lato), sizing for headings, paragraphs, and block quotes. Additionally, this page includes a guide on how the font sizing mechanism works for different view ports (mobile, tablet, and desktop).

* [Buttons](https://www.figma.com/file/CH7ZOCW55SgsDnsTj3UrTi/?node-id=1%3A1600) – Styling for different button states and types.

* [Forms](https://www.figma.com/file/CH7ZOCW55SgsDnsTj3UrTi/?node-id=44%3A1646) – A set of form question types including text, radio, checkbox, toggle, and selects.

* [Icons](https://www.figma.com/file/CH7ZOCW55SgsDnsTj3UrTi/?node-id=1%3A2001) – A selection of UI icons from the [Feather Icon Set](https://feathericons.com/) as well as two custom UI icons (translate and accessibility). Additionally, icon usage in links and buttons.
