The Accordion Component will toggle a region of content open or closed using attributes on the primary toggling element: `aria-controls`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-hidden`.

When implementing a set of accordions stacked on top of each other, the first accordion should be open when the user lands on the page. Additionally, opening one accordion does not automatically close the other accordions.
